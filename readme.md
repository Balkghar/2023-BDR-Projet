2. Open the terminal and navigate to the [Code](./Code/) folder of the repository
3. Change the right of the folder [images](./Code/src/images) with those commands :

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data images # change owership of the images folder to www-data
find images -type d -exec chmod 775 {} # change all the directories to 775 (write for user & group www-data, read for others)
